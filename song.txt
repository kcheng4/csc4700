We're All In This Together

Together, together, together everyone
Together, together, come on let's have some fun
Together, we're there for each other every time
Together, together come on let's do this right

Here and now
It's time for celebration
We finally figured it out (yeah, yeah)
That all our dreams
Have no limitations
That's what it's all about

Everyone
Is special in their own way
We make each other strong (we make each other strong)
We're not the same
We're different in a good way
Together's where we belong

We're all in this together
Once we know
That we are
We're all stars
And we see that
We're all in this together
And it shows
When we stand
Hand in hand
Make our dreams come true

Together, together, together everyone
Together, together, come on let's have some fun
Together, we're there for each other every time
Together, together come on let's do this right

We all here
And speaking out in one voice
We're gonna rock the house (rock the house, yeah,yeah)
The party's on
Now everybody make some noise
Come on scream and shout

We were right
Because we stuck together
Champions one and all

We're all in this together
Once we know
That we are
We're all stars
And we see that
We're all in this together
And it shows
When we stand
Hand in hand
Make our dreams come true

We're all in this together
When we reach we can fly
Know inside we can make it
We're all in this together
Once we see
There's a chance that we have
And we take it

Wildcats sing along
They've really got it going on
Wildcats in the house
Everybody say it now
Wild cats everywhere
Wave your hands up in the air
Thats the way we do it
Lets get to it
Time to show the world

We're all in this together
Once we know
That we are
We're all stars
And we see that
We're all in this together
And it shows
When we stand
Hand in hand
Make our dreams come true

We're all in this together
When we reach we can fly
Know inside we can make it
Were all in this together
Once we see there's a chance
That we have and we take it

Wild cats everywhere
Wave your hands up in the air
That's the way we do it
Let's get to it

Come on everyone!
